She denies any morning \\nstiffness, any jelling phenomena.  She has had no trauma or effusions in \\nthe knee.  She had noted on x-ray many years ago that she had had a \\nchipped bone in the right knee and some mild osteoarthritis but it has \\nbothered her only intermittently until this year.  Last year she did go \\nto Briggs Stratton and dropped to 270 lb. at which point her knees felt \\nbetter, but currently she is back up to over 300 lb. and at her height \\nof 5 ft. 1 in., she is in pain.  She has not visited a physician.  She \\nhas no internist who currently checks on her general medical health, but \\nshe does report that the occasional Advil she takes does produce some \\ndyspepsia.  She has no history of gout, no history of psoriasis, no \\nhistory of pseudogout or any rash, alopecia, headaches, shoulder or hip \\ndiscomfort.  She does not complain of back pain but does have difficult \\nwalking 50 yards because of the knee pain.\\n \\nAllergies:  None.\\n \\nMedications:  Occasional Advil.\\n \\nPast Surgical History:  Cholecystectomy 2064.  Two c-sections.\\n \\nPast Medical History:  Negative for hypertension, diabetes, cancer, \\nstroke, tuberculosis, hepatitis, asthma, heart disease.\\n \\nFamily History:  Mother is alive and well with no medical problems.  \\nFather is alive and well with no medical problems.  She has 12 siblings.  \\nOne sibling died of pneumonia at a young age.  Another sibling has \\nasthma.\\n \\nPhysical Examination;  She is a markedly obese female, no apparent \\ndistress.  She is 5 ft. 1 in. and weighs 304 lb.  Examination of joints:  \\nNo evidence of active synovitis or pain in her DIPs, PIPs, MCPs, wrists, \\nelbows, shoulders.  Bilateral hips are limited in internal external \\nrotation but not because of pain-- due to obesity, bilateral knees have \\ncrepitus, but no warmth or swelling.  There is some pain at extremes of \\nflexion on the left of 110 degrees.  Ankles and toes within normal \\nlimits.  Please note above in the clinical history that she does not \\ncomplain of back pain but does have difficult walking 50 yards because \\nof the knee pain.  The blood pressure could not be taken secondary to \\nthe fact that the large blood pressure \\ncuff did not fit around her right arm. \\n \\nImpression:  \\n \\n1.   Probable bilateral osteoarthritis.  I will obtain plain films and \\n     have prescribed Disalcid 3 gm. a day p.r.n.   GI and renal side \\n     effects explained.\\n                                              2-03-68\\n \\n \\n \\n2.   We discussed seriously the need for weight loss.  She will be \\n     referred to the nutritionist to get on a weight loss program.  She \\n     will seriously entertain a weight loss program.  Patient will \\n     return in a few months unless she has any further problems.\\n \\n3.   I have referred her to an Internal Medicine doctor for health maintenance since \\n     she does not have one as yet.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n_________________________\\nAda R.

She has had multiple admissions in the past for CHF and for ischemia.  Recent echo shows septal and apical hypokinesis.  \\n\\n\\n\\nShe has had no chest pain.  She does not complain of SOB.  She does cough, but this is because of the air conditioning and postnasal drip, she believes.  \\n\\n\\n\\nShe also complains of severe knee pain, with the right worse than the left.  She can walk a little, but standing is very painful.  \\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition, she complains of some food intolerance.  She has a hard time eating breakfast because she gets abdominal cramps.  After eating orange juice, she gets terrible cramping and has to run to the bathroom to have a bowel movement.  She has changed her milk to lactaid, which she says helps.  Certain types of salad dressing also cause this reaction.  \\n\\n\\n\\nProblems\\t  \\n\\nMORBID OBESITY\\t      \\n\\nKNEE OA\\t      \\n\\nANSERINE BURSITIS, BILAT\\t      \\n\\nS/P 2 C-SECTIONS\\t      \\n\\nHTN\\t      \\n\\nCAD\\t      \\n\\nCHF\\t      \\n\\nASTHMA\\t      \\n\\n\\n\\nMedications\\t  \\n\\nVENTOLIN\\t 2PUFFS INH QID\\n\\nAZMACORT\\t 4PUFFS INH BID\\n\\nECASA\\t 1  PO QD\\n\\nATROVENT\\t 2PUFFS INH QID\\n\\nTNG 0.4 MG\\t    SL \\n\\nSEREVENT\\t 2PUFFS INH BID\\n\\nFLOVENT\\t 220MCG INH BID\\n\\nCOZAAR\\t 100MG PO QD\\n\\nLOPRESSOR\\t 25MG PO TID\\n\\nLASIX\\t 60MG PO BID\\n\\nZANTAC\\t 150MG PO BID\\n\\nNORVASC\\t 10MG PO QD\\n\\nISOSORBIDE DINITRATE\\t 20MG 1 Tablet(s) PO TID\\n\\n\\n\\nAllergies\\t  \\n\\nLISINOPRIL\\t COUGH\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial History\\t\\n\\nEmployment:  Works in commercial diving.  \\n\\nMarital/Relationship:  She is married.
