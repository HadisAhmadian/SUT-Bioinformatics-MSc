# Genetic and evolution course 
### Problem 1 (HW1) :
Write a computer program with evolutionary algorithm that randomly makes a certain sentence.
use both Darwin and Lamarck approach. wich one converges to the answer faster?


### problem 2 (HW2) :
Write a computer program to plot the final stateof the logistic map.
Plot the value of final N versus r.
Change the value of r until you get chaos,determine the threshold r for chaos.

### problem 3 (HW5) 
Write a computer program to draw a graph for the changes of gene frequency, in a populationof size30, with two genotypes a and b, starting from p=q=0.5, and repeated from the resulting population, many generations.
What is the final state ?
Calculate the probabilities of observing various possible values of p, starting from p=0.5 in a population of size 30. 
Fit it with a normal distribution. What are the mean and variance of this normal distribution ?
Repeat this problem for p=0.05 , can you still fit a normal distribution ? If not, try a Poisson distribution.
